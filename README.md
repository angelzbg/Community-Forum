<h2>Community forum application for Android and Web</h2>
<h3>TO DO:</h3>
<h4>1. <strike>Structure the data</strike></h4>
<h4>2. <strike>Firebase Rules</strike></h4>
<h4>3. <strike>Firebase Cloud Functions</strike></h4>
<h4>4. Android app (Currently working on)</h4>
<h4>5. JS app</h4>
The android application may need some optimization with HashMaps for users and communities avatars (<String, String>), because they make high traffic, when they can be stored in the UIHelper.<br>
They may even be cached but then must be added avatarChanged field, because we must update them when changed.<br>
